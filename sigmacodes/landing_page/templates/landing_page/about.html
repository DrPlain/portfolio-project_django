    SigmaCodes data analysis and visualization services
  </h1>
  <p>
    This project is my portfolio project built as a student of Alx.
    SigmaCodes is all about helping our clients tell the stories behind
    their data using interactive visualizations. Our web services offer
    our users the ability to upload their data in csv or excel format and
    interactively generate their desired charts. It also ensures that the
    appropriate charts are used for visualizations hence enabling those
    without statistical knowledge to still use our services. <br><br>

    Our team of experienced researchers are available to offer professional
    writing services, data analysis and research consultation. Other services we offer
    include professional review of research papers, data cleaning services,
    questionnaire structuring and lots more.

    Motivation for this project
  </h1>
  <p>
    My passion for data science prompted me to find a way to automate data visualization
    processes such that those without indepth statistical knowledge can easily and
    accurately see the stories behind their data using interactive charts. Also, my love
    for backend web development informed my choice of using the django framework for
    this project.
